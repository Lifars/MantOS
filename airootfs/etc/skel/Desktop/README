====Cheat Codes Live====

Here is a list of codes that can be used at boot time, to edit boot options while
on boot menu hit Tab key then add code/s you require

sshd=on [start ssh service, password is not required live]
xorg=<driver_name> [nouveau,ati,savage,vesa]

====Installation====
Make sure that all the partitions of the disk on which you'll install ArchBang
Linux are unmounted & that the sound isn't used by any applications.

Select install from main openbox menu [right click].

Installer is a menu driven script you simply enter the number of the option and follow on
screen instructions.

Note the only option that is not required during install is mirrorlist.

Installation does not take that long, really depends on your systems hardware.


====Post Install====

This is optional, extra drivers do not take up that much room. Only really for older systems.

1) Check the "Video Driver" & "keyboard" sections

2) Comment or remove unnecessary mirrors in /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

3) Consult the rest of the DOC/Wiki/Forum to find answers to problems

====Video driver====
Remove xorg video drivers that were shipped with AB by typing:

Note the following drivers listed may not be up to date

You can check what drivers you have installed by running

 pacman -Qq | grep xf86-video

 sudo pacman -R xf86-video-apm xf86-video-ark xf86-video-ast\
 xf86-video-ati xf86-video-chips xf86-video-cirrus\
 xf86-video-dummy xf86-video-fbdev xf86-video-glint\
 xf86-video-i128 xf86-video-i740 xf86-video-intel-uxa\
 xf86-video-mach64 xf86-video-mga xf86-video-neomagic\
 xf86-video-nv xf86-video-r128 xf86-video-rendition\
 xf86-video-s3 xf86-video-s3virge xf86-video-savage\
 xf86-video-siliconmotion xf86-video-sis xf86-video-sisusb\
 xf86-video-tdfx xf86-video-trident xf86-video-tseng\
 xf86-video-v4l xf86-video-vesa xf86-video-vmware\
 xf86-video-voodoo xf86-video-xgi xf86-video-xgixp\
 ati-dri intel-dri mach64-dri mga-dri r128-dri\
 savage-dri sis-dri tdfx-dri

Type in terminal as root:

  rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-gpudriver.conf

To know your video chipset type in terminal

  lspci | grep VGA

Track it down in the list by typing in terminal as root:

 pacman -Ss xf86-video | less

Install your video driver:

 pacman -S your_video_driver

====Resolution====
Go in Preferences>Screen Resolution

====Maximum Brightness====
If you want maximum brightness at boot, uncomment the following in
~/.config/openbox/autostart
 xbacklight -set 100 &

====Sound====

If you don't get any sound you can right click on volume icon on panel then
'Open Mixer' or in a terminal run
 alsamixer
To unmute a channel press M to raise levels use up and down keys. To exit and
save hit Escape key

====Keyboard====

If you simply want to run a different keyboard layout then add the following to
~/.config/openbox/autostart

 setxkbmap us &

Change 'us' to layout of your choice [see below for more information]

You can set up to 4 different configurations in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-keyboard-layout.conf
You put the 2 letters that represent your country: ru Russia,
us United States, ca Canada, fr France, etc. you get the idea
A complete list can be found here:
[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Keyboard_layouts Arch Wiki Keyboard Layouts]
(Note: when the system starts, it will use by default the first option
you put for XkbLayout in line 5)

You must also uncomment the right locale(s) in /etc/locale.gen

Reboot and enjoy your right kb configuration!

====Disable Blank Screen After 10 Minutes====

To disable blank screen after 10 minutes of inactivity, create a file in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d called custom.conf with this code:

 Section "ServerFlags"
 # disable low-level screensaver and screen DPMS poweroff
    Option "BlankTime" "0"
    Option "StandbyTime" "0"
    Option "SuspendTime" "0"
    Option "OffTime" "0"
 EndSection

====Update the system====

Open a terminal [Windows Key + T] and type:
sudo pacman -Syyu

====Install an application====

If you know the name of the package you would like to install,
open the terminal and type

 pacman -S NameOfThePackage

For example:

 pacman -S firefox

And it will install firefox for you.

All right, now let's say you know the type of application you want
or the name of the application but you do not know the exact package
name, use the search function by typing in the terminal:

 pacman -Ss DescriptionOfWhatYouAreLookingFor

For example:

 pacman -Ss mozilla browser

You will get many results and the first one will most likely be
Firefox. Now you know the right package name (firefox) and you have a small
description of the package.

Let's say you're worried about the amount of space Firefox could take
once installed on your precious hard drive, you can have further
informations about a package by typing

 pacman -Si NameOfThePackage

For example:

 pacman -Si firefox

will let you know that the installed size of that package is 3.5MB. You'll also
know more about the package's
dependencies (such as xulrunner & desktop-file-utils)that are
automatically pulled if you do not have them already.

Finally, you need to know that there are Arch Linux main repositories which
are
core, extra, community that have the most common packages used by most
distributions. Packages for newer & less popular applications are often
located in the AUR (which is the Arch User Repository).

====Autostart an application====

Simply add the application in autostart.sh. Let's say you would like to
launch gimp when your system starts, you would go in Preferences>
Openbox Config>Edit autostart.sh and add the following line at the end:

gimp &

====Delete an application====

Run as root

 pacman -R ThePackageYouWantToDelete

for example:

 pacman -R firefox

will remove firefox.

You should keep in mind that the first time you installed Firefox, it installs
other required dependencies which are still on
your system! A cleaner way to remove firefox would be:

 pacman -Rnsc firefox

It will remove the package (firefox) and its dependencies (xulrunner &
desktop-file-utils) and its configuration files :D. You have to be
careful with this "cleaner" way of removing an application because you
could get rid of dependencies needed by another application.
For example: xulrunner is also needed by google-gadgets. If you do not
have google-gadgets installed on your system, then there's nothing to
worry about.

Everything about Arch isn't covered in this guide of course so check the Arch
Wiki please

====Grub Note====

Grub uses a default configuration file. If you have problems post install you
may not get any boot messages that will help. To show boot messages you
need to edit /etc/default/grub file. Look for the line:
 GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet ..."
Remove the word 'quiet' Save the file and run in a terminal

 sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
