### Lightweight Package

MantOS is both tiny and undemanding. Our goal is to provide investigators with an operating system that is convenient enough to meet the needs of someone who works on multiple machines. Total installation size is around 3 Gigabytes and takes a short amount of time to install. Since MantOS is easy on system resources it functions on older machines. MantOS can be deployed via live CD, flashdrive, or full OS installation.
