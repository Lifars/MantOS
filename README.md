## What is MantOS

MantOS is a GNU/Linux network security focused distro based on [Archbang](https://github.com/mrgreen3/archbang). 

We aim to provide the tools you need to analyze potential threats while being minimal.

## Key features

We have tools that do the following:

* Graphically analyze TCP dump files for time, size, segments, and throughput
* Create forensic images (bit by bit copies), complete disk wipe, data recovery, benchmarking harddrive performance
* Dump RAM contents to disk
* MITM-like functionality for intercepting network LAN data
* Analyze network protocols
* Wireless network detector, sniffer, instrusion detector
* Identify TCP connections and records traffic, can also decrypt the connection and identify the applications being used
* Track tcp streams across network users
* Track network performance through stack, protocol capture, spike tracking, and determine if there's been a compromise
* Snoop network traffic for telnet sessions
* Capture raw data and reconstruct the contents for web and email usage.
* Monitor wired and Wi-Fi sources for insecure requests
* Track VoIP calls and dump the conversations

### Lightweight package

MantOS is both tiny and undemanding. Our goal is to allow investigators to carry MantOS around with them everywhere they go. This means being convenient enough to meet the needs of someone who works on many different machines. Total installation size is around 3 Gigabytes and takes a short amount of time to install. Since MantOS is easy on system resources you can even use it on older machines. MantOS can be deployed via live CD, flashdrive, or full OS installation.

### Gratis and F/OSS

MantOS is free in both senses of the word. There is no charge for the distribution, just download it and go. Want to customize your MantOS installation? We provide the very code base we use to you, hassle free and also of no charge. Why do we do this? Because we believe in a forensic community that builds together. Help us make MantOS the best solution it could possibly be.
