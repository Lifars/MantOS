<h3><span style="color: black;">Lightweight package</span></h3>
<span style="color: black;"> </span>

<span style="color: black;">MantOS is both tiny and undemanding. Our goal was to allow investigators to carry MantOS around with them everywhere they go. This meant being convenient enough to meet the needs of someone who works on many different machines. Total installation size is around 3 Gigabytes and takes a short amount of time to install. Since MantOS is easy on system resources you can even use it on older machines. MantOS can be deployed via live CD, flashdrive, or full OS installation.</span>

<span style="color: black;"> </span>
<h3><span style="color: black;">Gratis and F/OSS</span></h3>
<span style="color: black;"> </span>

<span style="color: black;">MantOS is free in both senses of the word. There is no charge for the distribution, just download it and go. Want to customize your MantOS installation? We provide the very code base we use to you, hassle free and also of no charge. Why do we do this? Because we believe in a forensic community that builds together.
